# UFOs
Create a web table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list.

## Steps
•	Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript “standard” and JavaScript version ES6+. </br>
•	Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases. </br>
•	Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions. </br>
•	Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions. </br>
•	Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop). </br>
•	Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML. </br>

## Discussion
Create additional filters for the webpage. The advanced filtering capability will allow users to filter the data by multiple factors.</br>

•	Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.</br>
•	Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.</br>
•	Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.</br>

One Recommendation for Fruther Development: </br>
For now, users have to press the button for filter. Besides that, perhaps it's a good idea to add "Press Enter" for filter as well.
